This document briefly describes the ChanServ levels and behaviour.

Every user with level >= 3 can operate with the access list, given that:
   - When changing or deleting an user, this user must have a smaller
     level. When changing the level of an user, the new level must
     be less than or equal to the level of the user that is doing
     the change.
   - When adding new users, the new level must be less than or equal to
     the level of the user that is adding the another.
   - When operating with itself, the user can only delete itself from
     the access list.

Every user in the access list can:
   - Do /ChanServ unban #channel
   - View the access list and the akick list.
   - Change the channel topic or modes when with op status.

Every user with level >= 1 can:
   - Do /ChanServ voice #channel

Every user with level >= 2 can:
   - Do /ChanServ op #channel.
   - Do /ChanServ resetmodes #channel.
   
Every user with level >= 100 can:
   - Operate with the akick list.

Only the channel founder can:
   - Do /ChanServ set #channel founder nick
   - Do /ChanServ drop #channel

When the user of a channel founder is dropped, the successor is chosen
as the user of greater level in the channel access list. If there is
no users in the access list, the channel is dropped.
